# Expo CLI Error: Version Mismatch or Corrupted Cache

This repository demonstrates a common Expo CLI error related to version mismatches or corrupted caches.  The `expoBug.js` file simulates a scenario leading to the error, and `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions.

## Problem

The error occurs when the Expo CLI version is incompatible with the project's dependencies or if the local cache is corrupted. This can manifest as various error messages during `expo start` or other CLI commands.

## Solution

1. **Check Expo CLI Version:** Ensure your Expo CLI version is compatible with the project's `package.json` dependencies.
2. **Clear Cache:** Run `expo start --clear` to clear the Expo cache.  This often resolves issues stemming from corrupted cache data.
3. **Verify Project Configuration:** Carefully review the `package.json`, `app.json`, and `eas.json` (if applicable) files for any inconsistencies or incorrect settings.
4. **Update Dependencies:**  Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to ensure all project dependencies are up-to-date.
5. **Reinstall Node Modules:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
6. **Create a New Project:** In case the issue persists, creating a new Expo project and transferring the necessary components can help isolate the problem.
